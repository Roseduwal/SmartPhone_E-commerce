			<h1> Technology</h1>
			<p>Mobile technology follows the user wherever he or she goes. It is made up of two-way portable communication devices, computer devices, and the networking technology that connects them. Mobile technology is all around us, and it's just becoming bigger. Smartphone users have surpassed 3 billion1, and by 2022, the global mobile workforce is estimated to exceed 1.87 billion.</p>
			<p>One of the most significant technical revolutions in human history is being sparked by the cell phone. This is not an exaggeration. Although there are more mobile phones in use now than there are people, quantifying the relevance of the mobile phone to those who rely on it trivializes its importance to those who rely on it. People would rather eat less than give up their cell phone, according to surveys.</p>
			<p>By far, the cell phone's biggest benefit to society is increased productivity. When people are linked, they behave more effectively, especially when they can connect whenever, wherever, and to whoever they choose. Aside from that, the mobile phone is a great instrument that can be used to entertain, educate, increase safety, and make our lives easier.</p>
			<p>One of the fundamental purposes of contemporary technology is to reduce costs. People benefit from technology because it makes things easier and less expensive. There are many modern products, gadgets, or machines accessible at extremely low prices for folks who you could never conceive.One of the most important goals of contemporary technology is to save time.Technology also plays a significant role in the sphere of education, providing several benefits to both students and instructors.</p>
		    <p>For students, the most essential thing is their objectives and goals, which they must attain and study for. They lose interest in the subject as a result of their intensive use and addiction to technology. They are constantly requesting to use the computer, mobile phones, tablets, play stations, and other electronic devices. Our surroundings are also affected by modern technologies. Pollution of any form in our environment is hazardous to humans as well as other living creatures.</p>
		    <p>Change is nothing new in the realm of technology education, especially when it comes to curriculum. Curriculum innovation is not new in the realm of technology education, according to Putnam in 1992. Technology education has evolved over time, beginning with manual instruction in early American history and progressing through industrial arts, vocational education, and career education.</p>
